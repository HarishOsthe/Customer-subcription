# Customer-Subscription
In today's market, many companies have a mobile presence. Often, these companies provide free products/services in their mobile apps in an attempt to transition their customers to a paid membership. Some examples of paid products, which originate from free ones, are YouTube Red, Pandora premium, Audible Subscription, and You Need a Budget. Since marketing efforts are never free, these companies need to know exactly who to target with offers and promotions.
